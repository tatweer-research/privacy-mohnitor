What are Internet Protocol addresses ?
An Internet Protocol ( " IP " ) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ( " ISP " ) .
See tracking technology discussion above .
Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply .
One reason we might use your information is because you ’ve entered into an agreement with us .
For example , when you buy an On- Demand Geofilter and accepted our Custom Creative Tools Terms , we need to use some of your information to collect payment and make sure we show your Geofilter to the right people at the right place and time .
Another reason we might use your information is because we have —or a third party has —a legitimate interest in doing so .
For example , we need to use your information to provide and improve our services , including protecting your account , delivering your Snaps , providing customer support , and helping you find friends and content we think you ’ll like .
Because most of our services are free , we also use some information about you to try and show you ads you ’ll find interesting .
In some cases we ’ll ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes .
Even if we ’re not relying on consent to use your information , we may ask you for permission to access data like contacts and location .
We may be required to use your personal information to comply with the law , like when we respond to valid legal process or need to take action to protect our users .
Bases for Using Your Information
These conditions are called “ legal bases ” and , at Snap , we typically rely on one of four :
Contract .
Legitimate interest .
An important point to understand about legitimate interest is that our interests do n’t outweigh your right to privacy , so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data does n’t significantly impact your privacy or would be expected by you , or there is a compelling reason to do so .
We explain our legitimate business reasons for using your information in more detail here .
Consent .
If we do , we ’ll make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions .
Legal obligation .
Since November 15 , 2015 , our policy has been to notify Snapchatters when we receive legal process seeking their account information , with some exceptions .

Privacy Policy
Snap Inc. is a camera company .
Our products and services —including Snapchat , Bitmoji , Spectacles , advertising , and others that link to this Privacy Policy —provide fast and fun ways to express yourself , live in the moment , learn about the world , and have fun together !
When you use these services , you ’ll share some information with us .
So we want to be upfro nt about the information we collect , how we use it , whom we share it with , and the controls we give you to access , update , and delete your information .
That ’s why we ’ve written this Privacy Policy .
And it ’s why we ’ve tried to write it in a way that ’s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents .
Of course , if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy , just contact us .
You should read our entire Privacy Policy , but when you only have a few minutes or want to remember something later on , you can always take a look at this summary —so you can review some of the basics in just a few minutes .
Some final notes before we dive in :
We ’re happy to report that we participate in the EU - U.S. and Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks , which you can read more about here .
And , if you ’re in the EU , there ’s some extra information we ’d like to bring to your attention here .
Control Over Your Information
We want you to be in control of your information , so we provide you with the following tools .
Access , Correction , and Portability .
You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our apps .
You can also use Download My Data to obtain a copy of information that is n’t available in our apps in a portable format , so you can move it or store it wherever you want .
Because your privacy is important to us , we will ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information .
We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons , including , for example , if the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful .
Revoking permissions .
In most cases , if you let us use your information , you can simply revoke your permission by changing the settings in the app or on your device if your device offers those options .
Of course , if you do that , certain services may lose full functionality .
Deletion .
While we hope you ’ll remain a lifelong Snapchatter , if for some reason you ever want to delete your account , just go here to learn how .
You can also delete some information in the app , like photos you ’ve saved to Memories , Our Story submissions , and search history .
Advertising Preferences .
We try to show you ads that we think will be relevant to your interests .
If you would like to modify the information we and our advertising partners use to select these ads , you can do so in the app and through your device preferences .
Go here to learn more .
Communicating with other Snapchatters .
It ’s important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with .
That ’s why we ’ve built a number of tools in Settings that let you indicate , among other things , who you want to see your Stories , whether you ’d like to receive Snaps from just your friends or all Snapchatters , and whether you ’d like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again .
Go here to learn more .
We ’re constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike , so we can provide you with more relevant content and advertisements .
On our end , that means most messages —like Snaps and Chats —sent in Snapchat will be automatically deleted by default from our servers after we detect they ’ve been opened by all recipients or have expired .
Other content , like Story posts , are stored for longer .
We store other information for longer periods of time .
We store your basic account information —like your name , phone number , and email address —and list of friends until you ask us to delete them .
We store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use .
For example , if you use the Map , we store information about your favorite places for up to 40 days so we can personalize and improve your experience .
If location information is associated with a Snap , like those saved to Memories or posted to Our Story , we ’ll retain that location as long as we store the Snap .
We ’ll also delete most of the information we ’ve collected about you after you ’ve been inactive for a while —but do n’t worry , we ’ll try to contact you first !
There may be legal requirements to store your data and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content , if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations , or if your account or content created by you is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations .
Finally , we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law .

We Keep Your Information
